# WooCommerce Subscriptions One-to-One

Hides subscription products from the store that are currently subscribed to.

Use case: store owner wants products and subscriptions to have a one-to-one relationship, i.e. each product should only be subscribed to once. For example, subscription product is a child to be sponsored, and only one subscriber should be sponsoring that child at a time.

This plugin creates and maintains a list of products that have unended subscriptions associated with them, then hides these products from the store to make sure that only one person can subscribe to a specific product at a time. It doesn't change ability to check out with product, so that customer can pay for failed order through cart.
